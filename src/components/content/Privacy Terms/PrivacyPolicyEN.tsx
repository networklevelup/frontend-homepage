      <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
      Thank you very much for your interest in our company. Data protection is
      particularly important to the management of Sandra Thomas und Marcel
      Rödiger GbR. A use of the Internet pages of Sandra Thomas und Marcel
      Rödiger GbR is basically possible without any indication of personal data.
      However, if a person concerned wishes to make use of special services of
      our company via our website, it may be necessary to process personal data.
      If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no legal
      basis for such processing, we generally obtain the consent of the person
      concerned. The processing of personal data, such as the name, address,
      e-mail address or telephone number of a person concerned, is always
      carried out in accordance with the basic data protection regulation and in
      accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations
      applicable to Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR. By means of this data
      protection declaration, our company wishes to inform the public about the
      nature, scope and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and
      process. In addition, this privacy statement will inform individuals about
      their rights. Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR has implemented
      numerous technical and organisational measures to ensure the most complete
      possible protection of the personal data processed via this website.
      Nevertheless, Internet-based data transmissions can in principle have
      security gaps, so that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this
      reason, each person concerned is free to transmit personal data to us by
      alternative means, such as telephone. 1. definitions The privacy policy of
      Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR is based on the terminology used by
      the European Directive and Regulation Giver in the adoption of the Data
      Protection Basic Regulation (DS-GVO). Our data protection declaration
      should be easy to read and understand for the public as well as for our
      customers and business partners. In order to guarantee this, we would like
      to explain the terms used in advance. We use the following terms in this
      privacy statement, among others: (a) personal data Personal data is any
      information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
      (hereinafter "data subject"). A natural person shall be considered
      identifiable if he can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular
      by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
      location data, an online identifier or one or more specific
      characteristics expressing the physical, physiological, genetic,
      psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
      person. (b) data subject Data subject means any identified or identifiable
      natural person whose personal data are processed by the controller. (c)
      Processing Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is
      carried out with or without the aid of automated processes and which
      relates to personal data, such as collection, recording, organisation,
      sorting, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
      disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,
      alignment or association, qualification, erasure or destruction. (d)
      Limitation of processing Limitation of processing is the marking of stored
      personal data with the aim of limiting their future processing. e)
      Profiling Profiling is any automated processing of personal data
      consisting of the use of such personal data to evaluate certain personal
      aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict
      aspects relating to the work performance, economic situation, health,
      personal preferences, interests, reliability, conduct, whereabouts or
      movement of that natural person. (f) Pseudonymisation Pseudonymisation
      means the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data
      can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the
      provision of additional information, provided that such additional
      information is kept separately and is subject to technical and
      organisational measures ensuring that the personal data are not attributed
      to an identified or identifiable natural person. (g) controller or data
      controller The controller or data controller is the natural or legal
      person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with
      others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal
      data. Where the purposes and means of such processing are laid down by
      Union law or by the law of the Member States, the controller or
      controllers may be designated in accordance with Union law or with the law
      of the Member States on the basis of specific criteria. (h) Processor
      Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other
      body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. (i)
      Recipient The recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority,
      agency or other body to whom personal data are disclosed, whether or not
      that person is a third party. However, authorities which may receive
      personal data in the course of a specific investigation task under Union
      law or the law of the Member States shall not be considered as recipients.
      (j) Third parties Third party means any natural or legal person, public
      authority, agency or body other than the data subject, the controller, the
      processor and the persons authorised to process the personal data under
      the direct responsibility of the controller or processor. (k) consent
      Consent shall mean any voluntary, informed and unambiguous expression by
      the data subject of his or her will in the particular case, in the form of
      a statement or other unequivocal confirmatory act, indicating that he or
      she consents to the processing of his or her personal data. 2. the name
      and address of the controller The person responsible within the meaning of
      the Basic Data Protection Regulation, other data protection laws
      applicable in the Member States of the European Union and other provisions
      of a data protection nature is the Data Protection Commissioner: Sandra
      Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR Graf-Zeppelin-Straße 32 31157 Sarstedt
      Niedersachsen Germany Tel.: +4915122301610 E-Mail:
      info@network-levelup.com Website: www.network-levelup.com 3. cookies The
      Internet pages of Sandra Thomas and Marcel Rödiger GbR use cookies.
      Cookies are text files which are stored on a computer system via an
      Internet browser. Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies
      contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the
      cookie. It consists of a string of characters through which Internet pages
      and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the
      cookie was stored. This enables the visited Internet pages and servers to
      distinguish the individual browser of the person concerned from other
      Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A particular Internet
      browser can be recognized and identified by its unique cookie ID. The use
      of cookies enables Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR to provide users
      of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be
      possible without the setting of cookies. By means of a cookie, the
      information and offers on our website can be optimised in the interests of
      the user. Cookies enable us, as already mentioned, to recognize the users
      of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for
      users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that uses
      cookies does not have to re-enter his access data each time he visits the
      website because this is taken over by the website and the cookie stored on
      the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping
      basket in the online shop. The online shop remembers the items that a
      customer has placed in the virtual shopping basket via a cookie. The
      person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any
      time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and
      thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies
      that have already been set can be deleted at any time via an Internet
      browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common
      Internet browsers. If the person concerned deactivates the setting of
      cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may
      be fully usable under certain circumstances. 4. collection of general data
      and information The website of Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR
      collects a series of general data and information each time the website is
      accessed by a data subject or an automated system. These general data and
      information are stored in the log files of the server. The types and
      versions of browsers used may be recorded: (1) the operating system used
      by the accessing system, (2) the operating system used by the accessing
      system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses our
      website (so-called referrer), (4) the sub-sites accessed via an accessing
      system on our website, (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6)
      an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service
      provider of the accessing system and (8) other similar data and
      information used to avert dangers in the event of attacks on our
      information technology systems. Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR does
      not draw any conclusions about the person concerned when using this
      general data and information. Rather, this information is required to (1)
      correctly deliver the content of our website, (2) optimise the content of
      our website and the advertising for it, (3) guarantee the long-term
      functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of
      our website and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the
      information necessary for criminal prosecution in the event of a cyber
      attack. This anonymously collected data and information is therefore
      evaluated by Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR both statistically and
      with the aim of increasing data protection and data security in our
      company in order to ultimately ensure an optimum level of protection for
      the personal data processed by us. The anonymous data of the server log
      files are stored separately from all personal data provided by the person
      concerned. 5. registration on our website The data subject shall have the
      possibility to register on the website of the controller by providing
      personal data. The personal data transmitted to the data controller in
      this process is determined by the respective input mask used for
      registration. The personal data entered by the data subject shall be
      collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller and
      for its own purposes. The controller may arrange for the data to be
      disclosed to one or more processors, such as a parcel service, who will
      also use the personal data solely for internal purposes attributable to
      the controller. By registering on the controller's website, the IP address
      assigned to the data subject by the Internet service provider (ISP), the
      date and time of registration are also stored. This data is stored in
      order to prevent misuse of our services and, if necessary, to enable us to
      investigate criminal offences. In this respect, the storage of this data
      is necessary to safeguard the data controller. These data will not be
      passed on to third parties unless there is a legal obligation to do so or
      the data is used for criminal prosecution. The registration of the data
      subject with voluntary disclosure of personal data serves the purpose of
      the data controller to offer the data subject content or services which,
      due to the nature of the matter, can only be offered to registered users.
      Registered persons are free to modify the personal data provided during
      registration at any time or to have them completely deleted from the
      database of the data controller. The data controller shall provide any
      data subject with information on the personal data stored on the data
      subject at any time upon request. Furthermore, the data controller shall
      correct or delete personal data at the request or notice of the data
      subject, unless this is contrary to any legal obligation to retain such
      data. The entire staff of the data controller shall be available to the
      data subject as contact persons in this context. 6. subscription to our
      newsletter On the website of Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR users
      have the possibility to subscribe to the newsletter of our company. The
      personal data transmitted to the data controller when ordering the
      newsletter is determined by the input mask used for this purpose. Sandra
      Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR informs its customers and business partners
      about offers of the company in regular intervals by means of a newsletter.
      The newsletter of our company can only be received by the person concerned
      if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person
      concerned registers to receive the newsletter. For legal reasons, a
      confirmation e-mail in the double opt-in procedure will be sent to the
      e-mail address entered for the first time by the person concerned for the
      purpose of sending the newsletter. This confirmation e-mail is used to
      check whether the owner of the e-mail address as the person concerned has
      authorised receipt of the newsletter. When registering for the newsletter,
      we also store the IP address assigned by the Internet Service Provider
      (ISP) to the computer system used by the person concerned at the time of
      registration as well as the date and time of registration. The collection
      of this data is necessary in order to be able to trace the (possible)
      misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later point in time
      and therefore serves to legally safeguard the data controller. The
      personal data collected in the course of registering for the newsletter
      will be used exclusively for sending our newsletter. Furthermore,
      subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by e-mail if this is
      necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration in
      this respect, as might be the case in the event of changes to the
      newsletter offering or changes to the technical conditions. The personal
      data collected as part of the newsletter service will not be passed on to
      third parties. The subscription to our newsletter can be cancelled by the
      person concerned at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data,
      which the person concerned has given us for the newsletter dispatch, can
      be revoked at any time. For the purpose of the revocation of the consent
      an appropriate left is in each new type character. It is also possible at
      any time to unsubscribe from the newsletter dispatch directly on the
      website of the data controller or to inform the data controller of this in
      any other way. 7. Newsletter Tracking The newsletters of Sandra Thomas and
      Marcel Rödiger GbR contain so-called Zählpixel. A pixel-code is a
      miniature graphic that is embedded in e-mails that are sent in HTML format
      to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows statistical
      evaluation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Using
      the embedded pixel-code, Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR can
      recognize if and when an e-mail was opened by an affected person and which
      links in the e-mail were accessed by the affected person. Such personal
      data collected via the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are
      stored and evaluated by the data controller in order to optimise the
      newsletter dispatch and to adapt the content of future newsletters even
      better to the interests of the person concerned. This personal data will
      not be passed on to third parties. Affected persons are entitled at any
      time to revoke the relevant separate declaration of consent submitted via
      the double opt-in procedure. After a revocation these personal data will
      be deleted by the person responsible for the processing. Unsubscribing
      from receiving the newsletter will automatically be interpreted by Sandra
      Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR as a revocation. 8. routine deletion and
      blocking of personal data The controller shall process and store the
      personal data of the data subject only for the period of time necessary to
      achieve the storage purpose or where provided for by the European
      directive and regulation maker or another legislator in laws or
      regulations to which the controller is subject. If the storage purpose no
      longer applies or if a storage period prescribed by the European directive
      and regulation giver or another competent legislator expires, the personal
      data shall be blocked or deleted routinely and in accordance with the
      statutory provisions. 9. rights of the data subject a) Right to
      confirmation Every data subject shall have the right, granted by the
      European directive and regulation maker, to obtain from the controller
      confirmation as to whether personal data relating to him or her are being
      processed. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of
      confirmation, he or she may at any time contact an employee of the
      controller. b) Right of access Any person concerned by the processing of
      personal data has the right, granted by the European directive and
      regulation maker, to obtain at any time, free of charge, from the
      controller, information on the personal data relating to him which have
      been stored and a copy of that information. Furthermore, the European Data
      Protection Supervisor has granted the data subject access to the following
      information: the processing purposes the categories of personal data
      processed the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal
      data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third
      countries or international organisations if possible, the planned duration
      for which the personal data will be stored or, if that is not possible,
      the criteria for determining that duration the existence of a right to the
      rectification or erasure of personal data concerning him or her or to the
      limitation of the processing carried out by the controller or of a right
      to object to such processing the existence of a right of appeal to a
      supervisory authority if the personal data are not collected from the data
      subject: All available information on the origin of the data the existence
      of automated decision-making, including profiling, in accordance with
      Article 22(1) and (4) of the DS Block Exemption Regulation and, at least
      in these cases, meaningful information on the logic involved, the scope
      and the intended effects of such processing on the data subject The data
      subject also has the right to know whether personal data have been
      transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. If
      this is the case, the data subject shall also have the right to obtain
      information on the appropriate safeguards in connection with the transfer.
      If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of access, he or she may
      at any time contact a member of staff of the controller. (c) Right to
      rectification Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has
      the right, granted by the European directive and regulation maker, to
      request the rectification without delay of inaccurate personal data
      concerning him or her. Furthermore, the data subject shall have the right,
      having regard to the purposes of the processing, to request the completion
      of incomplete personal data, including by means of a supplementary
      statement. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of
      rectification, he or she may at any time contact a member of staff of the
      controller. d) Right to deletion (right to be forgotten) Any person data
      subject to the processing of personal data shall have the right, granted
      by the European directive and regulation, to require the controller to
      erase without delay personal data concerning him which are subject to one
      of the following conditions and to the extent that the processing is not
      necessary: The personal data have been collected for such purposes or
      processed in any other way for which they are no longer necessary. The
      data subject withdraws his consent on which the processing was based
      pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter a DS-GVO or Art. 9 para. 2 letter a
      DS-GVO and there is no other legal basis for the processing. The data
      subject objects to the processing under Article 21(1) DS Block Exemption
      Regulation and there are no overriding legitimate reasons for the
      processing or the data subject objects to the processing under Article
      21(2) DS Block Exemption Regulation. The personal data have been processed
      unlawfully. The deletion of the personal data is necessary to fulfil a
      legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member States to which
      the controller is subject. The personal data were collected in relation to
      information society services offered pursuant to Art. 8 para. 1 DS-GVO. If
      one of the above reasons applies and a data subject wishes to have
      personal data stored by Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR deleted, he
      may at any time contact an employee of the data controller. The employee
      of Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR will ensure that the request for
      deletion is complied with immediately. If the personal data have been made
      public by Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR and our company is
      responsible in accordance with Art. 17 Par. 1 DS-GVO, Sandra Thomas und
      Marcel Rödiger GbR, taking into account the available technology and the
      implementation costs, shall take appropriate measures, also of a technical
      nature, to inform other persons responsible for data processing who
      process the published personal data that the data subject has requested
      the deletion of all links to this personal data or copies or replications
      of this personal data from these other persons responsible for data
      processing, insofar as the processing is not necessary. The employee of
      Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR will take the necessary steps in
      individual cases. (e) Right to limitation of processing Any person data
      subject to the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the
      European directive and regulation, to request the controller to limit the
      processing if one of the following conditions is met: The accuracy of the
      personal data shall be contested by the data subject for a period of time
      which allows the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
      The processing is unlawful and the data subject refuses to erase the
      personal data and instead requests that the use of the personal data be
      restricted. The controller no longer needs the personal data for the
      purposes of processing, but the data subject needs them for the assertion,
      exercise or defence of legal rights. The data subject has lodged an
      objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 DS-GVO and it is
      not yet clear whether the legitimate reasons of the data controller
      outweigh those of the data subject. If one of the above conditions is met
      and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of personal data
      stored at Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR, he can contact an employee
      of the data controller at any time. The employee of Sandra Thomas und
      Marcel Rödiger GbR will arrange for the processing to be restricted. f)
      Right to data transferability Any data subject involved in the processing
      of personal data has the right, granted by the European directive and
      regulation, to obtain personal data concerning him or her which have been
      provided by the data subject to a controller in a structured, common and
      machine-readable format. It also has the right to communicate these data
      to another controller without being hindered by the controller to whom the
      personal data have been provided, provided that the processing is based on
      the consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter a DS-GVO or Art. 9 para. 2
      letter a DS-GVO or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter b
      DS-GVO and the processing is carried out by automated means, provided that
      the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out
      in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority entrusted
      to the controller. Furthermore, when exercising his right to data
      transferability pursuant to Art. 20 (1) DS Block Exemption Regulation, the
      data subject shall have the right to obtain that the personal data be
      transferred directly from one data controller to another data controller
      insofar as this is technically feasible and insofar as this does not
      impair the rights and freedoms of other persons. In order to assert the
      right to data transfer, the person concerned can contact an employee of
      Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR at any time. g) Right of objection
      Any person data subject to the processing of personal data has the right,
      granted by the European directive and regulation maker, to object at any
      time, for reasons related to his/her particular situation, to the
      processing of personal data concerning him/her on the basis of Article
      6(1)(e) or (f) of the DS Block Exemption Regulation. This also applies to
      profiling based on these provisions. Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR
      will no longer process the personal data in the event of an objection,
      unless we can prove compelling grounds for processing worthy of protection
      which outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or
      the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. If
      Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR processes personal data in order to
      carry out direct advertising, the person concerned has the right to object
      at any time to the processing of personal data for the purpose of such
      advertising. This also applies to profiling as far as it is connected with
      such direct advertising. If the person concerned objects to Sandra Thomas
      und Marcel Rödiger GbR processing the data for direct marketing purposes,
      Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR will no longer process the personal
      data for these purposes. Furthermore, the data subject has the right to
      object to the processing of personal data concerning him/her by Sandra
      Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR for scientific or historical research
      purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with Art. 89 para. 1
      DS-GVO for reasons arising from his particular situation, unless such
      processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public
      interest. In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may
      contact any employee of Sandra Thomas und Marcel Rödiger GbR or another
      employee directly. The data subject is also free to exercise his or her
      right of objection in connection with the use of information society
      services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, by means of automated
      procedures in which technical specifications are used. (h) Automated
      case-by-case decisions including profiling Any person data subject to the
      processing of personal data has the right under the European Directive and
      Regulation not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated
      processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects upon him or
      her or significantly affects him or her in a similar manner, provided that
      the decision (1) is not necessary for the conclusion or performance of a
      contract between the data subject and the data controller, or (2) is
      authorised by Union or national law or by the Member States to which the
      data controller is subject and which provides for adequate measures to
      safeguard the rights and freedoms and the legitimate interests of the data
      subject, or (3) is taken with the express consent of the data subject.
      Where the decision (1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a
      contract between the data subject and the data controller or (2) is taken
      with the express consent of the data subject, Sandra Thomas und Marcel
      Rödiger GbR shall take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights,
      freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, including at least
      the right to obtain the intervention of a data subject from the data
      controller, to present his or her point of view and to contest the
      decision. If the data subject wishes to exercise rights relating to
      automated decisions, he or she may at any time do so by contacting an
      employee of the controller. i) Right to revoke consent under data
      protection law Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has
      the right, granted by the European directive and regulation maker, to
      revoke consent to the processing of personal data at any time. If the data
      subject wishes to exercise his or her right to withdraw consent, he or she
      may at any time do so by contacting an employee of the controller. 10.
      data protection for applications and in the application procedure The data
      controller collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the
      purpose of processing the application procedure. Processing may also be
      carried out electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant
      submits the relevant application documents electronically, for example by
      e-mail or via a web form on the website, to the data controller. If the
      data controller concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the
      data transmitted shall be stored for the purpose of processing the
      employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If
      the controller does not conclude a contract of employment with the
      applicant, the application documents shall be automatically deleted two
      months after notification of the rejection decision, unless deletion
      conflicts with any other legitimate interests of the controller. Other
      legitimate interests in this sense include, for example, the duty to
      provide evidence in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act
      (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz - AGG). 11. privacy policy regarding
      the use and enjoyment of Facebook The data controller has integrated
      Facebook components on this website. Facebook is a social network. A
      social network is a social meeting point operated on the Internet, an
      online community that usually enables users to communicate with each other
      and interact in virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform
      for the exchange of opinions and experiences or enables the Internet
      community to provide personal or company-related information. Facebook
      enables users of the social network to create private profiles, upload
      photos and network via friend requests. The operating company of Facebook
      is Facebook, Inc. 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. The person
      responsible for processing personal data is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand
      Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland if a person concerned
      lives outside the USA or Canada. Each time one of the individual pages of
      this website is accessed, operated by the data controller and on which a
      Facebook component (Facebook plug-in) has been integrated, the Internet
      browser on the information technology system of the data subject is
      automatically prompted by the respective Facebook component to download a
      representation of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook. A
      complete overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at
      https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE As part of this
      technical process, Facebook obtains information about which specific
      subpage of our website is visited by the person concerned. If the person
      concerned is logged into Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes
      which specific page of our website the person concerned is visiting each
      time the person visits our website and for the entire duration of the
      person's stay on our website. This information is collected by the
      Facebook component and assigned by Facebook to the respective Facebook
      account of the person concerned. If the person concerned clicks one of the
      Facebook buttons integrated on our website, for example the "Like" button,
      or if the person concerned makes a comment, Facebook assigns this
      information to the personal Facebook user account of the person concerned
      and stores this personal data. Facebook receives information through the
      Facebook component that the individual concerned has visited our website
      whenever the individual concerned is logged into Facebook at the same time
      as accessing our website, whether or not the individual clicks on the
      Facebook component. If the data subject does not want this information to
      be transferred to Facebook in this way, he or she can prevent the transfer
      by logging out of his or her Facebook account before accessing our
      website. Facebook's published privacy policy, available at
      https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, discloses Facebook's
      collection, processing and use of personal information. It also explains
      what settings Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the person
      concerned. In addition, various applications are available that make it
      possible to suppress data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can
      be used by the data subject to suppress data transmission to Facebook. 12.
      privacy policy regarding the use and enjoyment of Google AdSense The
      person responsible for the processing has integrated Google AdSense on
      this website. Google AdSense is an online service that enables the
      placement of advertisements on third-party sites. Google AdSense is based
      on an algorithm that selects the advertisements displayed on third party
      sites according to the content of the respective third party sites. Google
      AdSense allows an interest-related targeting of the Internet user, which
      is implemented by generating individual user profiles. The operating
      company of the Google AdSense component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon
      House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland. The purpose of the Google
      AdSense component is to include advertisements on our website. Google
      AdSense places a cookie on the data subject's information technology
      system. What cookies are has been explained above. The setting of cookies
      enables Alphabet Inc. to analyse the use of our website. Each time one of
      the individual pages of this website is accessed, which is operated by the
      data controller and on which a Google AdSense component has been
      integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of
      the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google
      AdSense component to transmit data to Alphabet Inc. for the purpose of
      online advertising and the billing of commissions. As part of this
      technical process, Alphabet Inc. obtains knowledge of personal data, such
      as the IP address of the person concerned, which Alphabet Inc. uses, among
      other things, to track the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently
      to enable it to bill commissions. The person concerned can prevent the
      setting of cookies by our website at any time, as described above, by
      means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus
      permanently oppose the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet
      browser used would also prevent Alphabet Inc. from setting a cookie on the
      information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a
      cookie already set by Alphabet Inc. can be deleted at any time via the
      Internet browser or other software programs. Google AdSense also uses
      so-called tracking pixels. A pixel-code is a miniature graphic that is
      embedded in Internet pages to enable a log file recording and a log file
      analysis, whereby a statistical evaluation can be carried out. Based on
      the embedded pixel-code, Alphabet Inc. can recognize if and when a website
      was opened by an affected person and which links were clicked by the
      affected person. Counting pixels are used, among other things, to evaluate
      the visitor flow of a website. Through Google AdSense, personal data and
      information, including the IP address and necessary for the collection and
      billing of the advertisements displayed, is transferred to Alphabet Inc.
      in the United States of America. This personal data is stored and
      processed in the United States of America. Alphabet Inc. may share this
      personal information collected through the technical process with third
      parties. Google AdSense is explained in more detail under this link
      https://www.google.de/intl/de/adsense/start/ . 13. privacy policy for the
      use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function) The data controller
      has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymisation
      function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web
      analysis is the collection, collection and evaluation of data on the
      behaviour of visitors to Internet pages. A web analysis service collects
      data on, among other things, from which website a person concerned came to
      a website (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were
      accessed or how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. A web
      analysis is mainly used to optimise a website and to analyse the costs and
      benefits of Internet advertising. The operating company of the Google
      Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow
      Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland. The data controller uses the addition
      "_gat._anonymizeIp" for the web analysis via Google Analytics. This
      addition is used by Google to shorten and anonymise the IP address of the
      Internet connection of the person concerned if access to our Internet
      pages is from a member state of the European Union or from another state
      party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The purpose of the
      Google Analytics component is to analyse the flow of visitors to our
      website. Google uses the data and information obtained, among other
      things, to evaluate the use of our website, to compile online reports for
      us showing the activities on our website and to provide other services in
      connection with the use of our website. Google Analytics places a cookie
      on the information technology system of the person concerned. What cookies
      are has already been explained above. When the cookie is set, Google is
      able to analyse the use of our website. Each time you access one of the
      individual pages of this website, which is operated by the data controller
      and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the
      Internet browser on the information technology system of the person
      concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics
      component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis.
      As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal
      data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which Google uses,
      among other things, to track the origin of visitors and clicks and
      subsequently to enable commission statements. The cookie is used to store
      personal information such as the access time, the location from which the
      access originated and the frequency of visits to our website by the person
      concerned. Each time you visit our website, this personal data, including
      the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is
      transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data
      is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may share this
      personal data collected through the technical process with third parties.
      The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as
      described above, at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the
      Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of
      cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent
      Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the
      person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics
      can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software
      programs. Furthermore, it is possible for the person concerned to object
      to and prevent the collection of data generated by Google Analytics and
      relating to the use of this website and the processing of this data by
      Google. For this purpose, the person concerned must download and install a
      browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout .
      This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data
      and information on visits to Internet pages may be transmitted to Google
      Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered a
      contradiction by Google. If the data subject's information technology
      system is later deleted, formatted or reinstalled, the data subject must
      reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. If
      the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the person concerned
      or by another person within his/her sphere of control, the browser add-on
      may be reinstalled or reactivated. For more information and to review
      Google's current privacy policies, please visit

      explained in more detail at this link,
      https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/ 14. privacy policy regarding
      the use and application of Google Remarketing The data controller has
      integrated Google Remarketing services into this website. Google
      Remarketing is a Google AdWords feature that enables a company to display
      advertisements to Internet users who have previously been on the company's
      website. The integration of Google Remarketing therefore allows a company
      to create user-related advertisements and consequently to display
      advertisements of interest to the Internet user. Google Remarketing
      services are operated by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow
      Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland. The purpose of Google Remarketing is to
      display advertisements of interest. Google Remarketing allows us to
      display advertisements through the Google advertising network or on other
      websites that are tailored to the individual needs and interests of
      Internet users. Google Remarketing places a cookie on the information
      technology system of the person concerned. What cookies are has already
      been explained above. When cookies are set, Google is able to recognize
      visitors to our website who subsequently visit websites that are also
      members of the Google advertising network. Each time a website is accessed
      on which the Google Remarketing service has been integrated, the Internet
      browser of the person concerned automatically identifies itself to Google.
      As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal
      data, such as the IP address or surfing behaviour of the user, which
      Google uses, among other things, to display advertisements relevant to the
      interests of the user. The cookie is used to store personal information,
      such as the Internet pages visited by the person concerned. Accordingly,
      each time you visit our website, personal data, including the IP address
      of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to
      Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by
      Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose personal data
      collected through this technical process to third parties. The person
      concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as described
      above, at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet
      browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a
      setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from
      setting a cookie on the information technology system of the person
      concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be
      deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
      Furthermore, the person concerned has the opportunity to object to the
      interest-related advertising by Google. To do this, the person concerned
      must access the link www.google.de/settings/ads from any of the Internet
      browsers he or she uses and make the desired settings there. Further
      information and the valid data protection regulations of Google can be
      called up under https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ 15.
      privacy policy regarding the use of Google AdWords The person responsible
      for the processing has integrated Google AdWords on this website. Google
      AdWords is an Internet advertising service that allows advertisers to
      place ads both in Google's search engine results and in the Google
      advertising network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define
      keywords that will be used to display an ad in Google's search engine
      results only when the user uses the search engine to retrieve a keyword
      relevant search result. In the Google advertising network, the ads are
      distributed to topic-relevant Internet pages using an automatic algorithm
      and taking into account the previously defined keywords. The company
      operating the Google AdWords services is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon
      House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland. The purpose of Google
      AdWords is to promote our website by displaying advertisements of interest
      on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of
      Google and by displaying third-party advertisements on our website. If a
      data subject reaches our website via a Google advertisement, a so-called
      conversion cookie is stored by Google on the data subject's information
      technology system. What cookies are has already been explained above. A
      conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and does not serve
      to identify the person concerned. If the cookie has not yet expired, the
      conversion cookie is used to track whether certain subpages, such as the
      shopping cart of an online shop system, have been accessed on our website.
      The conversion cookie enables both we and Google to track whether a person
      who came to our website via an AdWords ad generated a turnover, i.e.
      completed or cancelled a purchase. The data and information collected
      through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to compile
      visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are in turn used
      by us to determine the total number of users who were referred to us via
      AdWords ads, i.e. to determine the success or failure of the respective
      AdWords ad and to optimise our AdWords ads for the future. Neither our
      company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from
      Google that could be used to identify the person concerned. The conversion
      cookie is used to store personal information, such as the Internet pages
      visited by the person concerned. Accordingly, each time you visit our
      website, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet
      connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to Google in the
      United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the
      United States of America. Google may disclose personal data collected
      through this technical process to third parties. The person concerned can
      prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as described above, at any
      time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and
      thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the
      Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a conversion
      cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In
      addition, a cookie already set by Google AdWords can be deleted at any
      time via the Internet browser or other software programs. Furthermore, the
      person concerned has the opportunity to object to the interest-related
      advertising by Google. To do this, the person concerned must access the
      link www.google.de/settings/ads from any of the Internet browsers he or
      she uses and make the desired settings there. Further information and the
      valid data protection regulations of Google can be called up under
      https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ 16. privacy policy
      regarding the use and application of Instagram The data controller has
      integrated components of the Instagram service on this website. Instagram
      is a service that qualifies as an audiovisual platform that allows users
      to share photos and videos and also to distribute such data on other
      social networks. Instagram's services are operated by Facebook Ireland
      Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland. Each
      time one of the individual pages of this website is accessed by the data
      controller and an Instagram component (Insta button) has been integrated,
      the Internet browser on the data subject's information technology system
      is automatically prompted by that Instagram component to download a
      representation of that Instagram component. As part of this technical
      process, Instagram is informed of which specific subpage of our website is
      visited by the person concerned. If the person concerned is logged into
      Instagram at the same time, Instagram recognizes which specific page the
      person concerned is visiting each time the person visits our website and
      for the entire duration of that person's stay on our website. This
      information is collected by the Instagram component and assigned by
      Instagram to the Instagram account of the person concerned. If the data
      subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website,
      the data and information transmitted is assigned to the personal Instagram
      user account of the data subject and stored and processed by Instagram.
      Instagram receives information from the Instagram component that the
      person concerned has visited our site whenever they are logged into
      Instagram at the same time as they visit our site, regardless of whether
      or not they click on the Instagram component. If the data subject does not
      want Instagram to receive this information, they can prevent the
      transmission by logging out of their Instagram account before accessing
      our website. For more information and to review Instagram's current
      privacy policies, please visit https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388
      and https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/ 17. privacy policy on
      the use and application of LinkedIn The data controller has integrated
      LinkedIn Corporation components into this website. LinkedIn is an
      Internet-based social network that allows users to connect to existing
      business contacts and make new business contacts. Over 400 million
      registered users use LinkedIn in more than 200 countries. This makes
      LinkedIn currently the largest platform for business contacts and one of
      the most visited websites in the world. LinkedIn is operated by LinkedIn
      Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. For privacy
      matters outside the United States, LinkedIn Ireland, Privacy Policy
      Issues, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland, is responsible.
      Each time a LinkedIn component (LinkedIn plug-in) is installed on our
      website, the LinkedIn component causes the browser used by the individual
      to download an appropriate representation of the LinkedIn component. More
      information about LinkedIn plug-ins can be found at
      https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins . As part of this technical
      process, LinkedIn receives information about which specific subpage of our
      website is visited by the person concerned. If the person concerned is
      logged in to LinkedIn at the same time, LinkedIn recognizes which specific
      page of our website the person concerned is visiting each time the person
      visits our website and for the entire duration of that person's stay on
      our website. This information is collected by the LinkedIn component and
      assigned by LinkedIn to the respective LinkedIn account of the person
      concerned. If the person concerned clicks on an integrated LinkedIn button
      on our website, LinkedIn assigns this information to the personal LinkedIn
      user account of the person concerned and saves this personal data.
      LinkedIn always receives information through the LinkedIn component that
      the person concerned has visited our website if the person concerned is
      logged in to LinkedIn at the same time as accessing our website; this
      occurs regardless of whether the person concerned clicks on the LinkedIn
      component or not. If the data subject does not want LinkedIn to receive
      such information, he or she can prevent the transmission by logging out of
      his or her LinkedIn account before accessing our website. At
      https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls LinkedIn offers the
      possibility to unsubscribe from e-mail messages, SMS messages and targeted
      ads as well as to manage ad settings. LinkedIn also uses partners such as
      Quantcast, Google Analytics, BlueKai, DoubleClick, Nielsen, Comscore,
      Eloqua and Lotame who can set cookies. Such cookies may be declined at
      https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy LinkedIn's current privacy
      policy can be found at https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy
      LinkedIn's cookie policy is available at
      https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy 18. privacy policy regarding
      the use and application of Xing The data controller has integrated Xing
      components into this website. Xing is an Internet-based social network
      that allows users to connect to existing business contacts and make new
      business contacts. Individual users can create a personal profile of
      themselves at Xing. Companies can, for example, create company profiles or
      publish job offers on Xing. Xing's operating company is XING SE,
      Dammtorstraße 30, 20354 Hamburg, Germany. Each time one of the individual
      pages of this Internet site is accessed, which is operated by the data
      controller and on which an Xing component (Xing plug-in) has been
      integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of
      the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective Xing
      component to download a representation of the corresponding Xing component
      from Xing. Further information on the Xing plug-ins can be found at
      https://dev.xing.com/plugins . As part of this technical process, Xing
      obtains information about which specific subpage of our website is visited
      by the person concerned. If the person concerned is logged in to Xing at
      the same time, Xing recognizes which specific page of our website the
      person concerned is visiting each time the person concerned accesses our
      website and for the entire duration of that person's stay on our website.
      This information is collected by the Xing component and assigned by Xing
      to the respective Xing account of the person concerned. If the person
      concerned activates one of the Xing buttons integrated on our website, for
      example the "Share" button, Xing assigns this information to the personal
      Xing user account of the person concerned and saves this personal data.
      Xing always receives information via the Xing component that the person
      concerned has visited our website if the person concerned is logged in to
      Xing at the same time as accessing our website; this takes place
      regardless of whether the person concerned clicks on the Xing component or
      not. If the data subject does not wish to transmit this information to
      Xing in this way, he or she can prevent the transmission by logging out of
      his or her Xing account before accessing our website. The data protection
      regulations published by Xing, which can be accessed at
      https://www.xing.com/privacy, provide information about the collection,
      processing and use of personal data by Xing. In addition, Xing has
      published data protection information for the XING Share button at
      https://www.xing.com/app/share?op=data_protection 19. data protection
      provisions on the use and application of YouTube The data controller has
      integrated YouTube components into this website. YouTube is an Internet
      video portal that enables video publishers to post video clips and other
      users to view, rate and comment on them free of charge. YouTube allows the
      publication of all types of videos, which is why complete film and
      television programmes, but also music videos, trailers or videos made by
      users themselves can be accessed via the Internet portal. YouTube is
      operated by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin,
      D04 E5W5, Ireland. Each time a YouTube component (YouTube video) has been
      integrated into one of the individual pages of this website, which is
      operated by the data controller, the YouTube component automatically
      prompts the Internet browser on the data subject's information technology
      system to download a display of the corresponding YouTube component from
      YouTube. Further information on YouTube can be found at
      https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/ As part of this technical process,
      YouTube and Google obtain information about which specific subpage of our
      website is visited by the person concerned. If the person concerned is
      logged into YouTube at the same time, YouTube recognizes which specific
      subpage of our website the person concerned is visiting by calling up a
      subpage containing a YouTube video. This information is collected by
      YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the
      person concerned. YouTube and Google always receive information via the
      YouTube component that the person concerned has visited our website if the
      person concerned is logged on to YouTube at the same time as accessing our
      website; this occurs regardless of whether the person concerned clicks on
      a YouTube video or not. If the data subject does not want YouTube and
      Google to receive such information, they may prevent the transmission by
      logging out of their YouTube account before visiting our website. The data
      protection regulations published by YouTube, which can be accessed at
      https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/, provide information about
      the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.
      20. payment method: Privacy policy of PayPal as payment method The data
      controller has integrated PayPal components into this website. PayPal is
      an online payment service provider. Payments are processed through
      so-called PayPal accounts, which are virtual private or business accounts.
      PayPal also offers the option of processing virtual payments via credit
      cards if a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account is
      managed via an e-mail address, which is why there is no classic account
      number. PayPal makes it possible to initiate online payments to third
      parties or to receive payments. PayPal also acts as a trustee and offers
      buyer protection services. The European operating company of PayPal is
      PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal L-2449,
      Luxembourg. If the person concerned selects "PayPal" as the payment option
      during the ordering process in our online shop, the data of the person
      concerned is automatically transferred to PayPal. By selecting this
      payment option, the person concerned consents to the transfer of personal
      data required for payment processing. The personal data transmitted to
      PayPal is usually first name, surname, address, email address, IP address,
      telephone number, mobile phone number or other data necessary for payment
      processing. For the completion of the sales contract such personal data
      are also necessary, which stand in connection with the respective order.
      The transmission of the data is intended for payment processing and fraud
      prevention. The person responsible for the processing will transfer
      personal data to PayPal in particular if there is a justified interest in
      the transfer. The personal data exchanged between PayPal and the data
      controller may be transferred by PayPal to credit agencies. The purpose of
      this transfer is to check identity and creditworthiness. PayPal may
      transfer the personal data to affiliated companies and service providers
      or subcontractors if this is necessary to fulfil the contractual
      obligations or if the data is to be processed on behalf of the customer.
      The person concerned has the opportunity to revoke his or her consent to
      the handling of personal data at PayPal at any time. A revocation does not
      affect personal data that must be processed, used or transmitted for
      (contractual) payment processing. The valid data protection regulations of
      PayPal can be found at
      https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full 21. legal basis for
      the processing Art. 6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves our company as a legal basis
      for processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific
      processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for
      the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is
      the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for
      the delivery of goods or the provision of other services or consideration,
      the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b DS-GVO. The same shall apply to
      such processing operations which are necessary for the implementation of
      pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries regarding our
      products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation
      which requires the processing of personal data, such as for the fulfilment
      of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c DS-GVO. In
      rare cases, the processing of personal data may become necessary in order
      to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural
      person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor to our site were
      injured and his name, age, health insurance information or other vital
      information would have to be disclosed to a doctor, hospital or other
      third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d DS-GVO.
      Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f
      DS-GVO. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the
      aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing
      is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third
      party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental
      freedoms of the data subject do not predominate. Such processing
      operations are permitted to us in particular because they have been
      specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, it
      took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data
      subject is a customer of the data controller (recital 47 sentence 2
      DS-GVO). 22. legitimate interests in the processing pursued by the
      controller or a third party If the processing of personal data is based on
      Article 6 I lit. f DS-GVO, our legitimate interest is the conduct of our
      business for the benefit of all our employees and shareholders. 23.
      Duration for which personal data is stored The criterion for the duration
      of the storage of personal data is the respective legal retention period.
      After this period has expired, the corresponding data will be routinely
      deleted unless they are no longer required for the fulfilment or
      initiation of the contract. 24. legal or contractual provisions relating
      to the provision of personal data; the need to conclude a contract; the
      obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; the possible
      consequences of not providing the personal data We will inform you that
      the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax
      regulations) or may result from contractual provisions (e.g. information
      on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary for a contract
      to be concluded that a person concerned makes personal data available to
      us which must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the data
      subject is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company
      concludes a contract with him or her. Failure to provide personal data
      would mean that the contract could not be concluded with the data subject.
      The data subject must contact one of our employees before providing
      personal data. Our employee will inform the data subject on a case-by-case
      basis whether the provision of personal data is required by law or
      contract or is necessary for the conclusion of a contract, whether there
      is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of not
      providing the personal data. 25. existence of automated decision making As
      a responsible company, we refrain from automatic decision-making or
      profiling.
