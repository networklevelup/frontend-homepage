      <p>1. Liability for contents</p>
      <p>
        The content of our website was created with the greatest possible care.
        However, we do not guarantee that this content is correct, complete, up
        to date or pleasing. According to § 7 Abs. 1 TMG we are responsible for
        the content, even if it has been ordered.
      </p>

      <p>
        In accordance with §§ 8, 9 and 10 TMG, we are under no obligation to
        monitor information transmitted or stored by third parties or to
        investigate circumstances that indicate unlawful activities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Not affected by this is our obligation to block or remove information
        which derives from the general laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we are not liable until we become aware of a concrete violation
        of rights. We will then immediately remove the relevant content.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>2. Liability for links</p>
      <p>
        Our website contains links to external websites of third parties.
        However, we have no influence on their content. It is therefore not
        possible for us to guarantee these contents.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The responsibility for this always lies with the respective
        provider/operator of the corresponding website. We check the websites
        linked by us at the time of linking for a possible infringement in full
        width.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, we cannot be expected to constantly monitor the content of the
        linked websites without a concrete indication. However, if we become
        aware of a violation of the law, we will immediately remove the
        corresponding link, which we can do.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>3. Copyright</p>
      <p>
        The contents of our website are, as far as possible, protected by
        copyright. A written permission of the creator is required for the
        person who copies, edits, distributes or uses the contents.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Downloading and copying our website is to be permitted by us in writing
        for both private and commercial use. We would like to point out that we
        have at all times observed the copyright of third parties with regard to
        the contents of our website, insofar as they have not been created by
        us.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you would inform us that you have nevertheless found a copyright
        infringement, we would greatly appreciate it. We would then be able to
        remove the corresponding content immediately and would no longer
        infringe the copyright.
