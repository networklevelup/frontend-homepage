  "faq_title":"FAQ",
  "faq_explanation":  "This FAQ is without obligation and does not replace legal advice.", 
  "faq_first": "+ What opportunities exist for a European talent to work for my German company?",
  "faq_first1": "According to German labour law, the following applies in principle: The employer determines the place of work and the working hours.",
  "faq_first2": "An employee has no legal claim to remote work or flexible working hours.",
  "faq_first3": "Usual case: An EU citizen with permanent residence in Spain works for a company in Germany.",
  "faq_headline1":  "1st possibility - self-employment",
  "faq_text1": "The talent is independent. It signs a (vendor) contract with the company and submits an invoice to the company before/after performance. The talent is responsible for the correct payment of taxes and insurance contributions.",
  "faq_text1Headline": "Focus - Spain:", 
  "faq_text11": "Unlike in Germany, the talent may only work for one company as Autonomo dependiente and is not accused of false self-employment.",
  "faq_text1Headline2": "For talents:",
  "faq_text12": "1. first, you register with the social security authorities. To do this, you must submit model TA0521 to one of the social security administrations, together with a photocopy of your identity card, at the earliest 60 days, but definitely in time, before your service is provided.",
  "faq_text13": "2. you also have to register at the Spanish tax office before you start working. To do this, you need to submit the census declaration (forms 036 (ordinary regulation) and 037 (simplified regulation)), in which you provide your personal details, the activity, the location of your company and the taxes you are required to pay.", 
  "faq_text14": "3. as a grant, you will usually receive a 20% income tax reduction from the Spanish state in the first two fiscal years.", 
  "faq_text15": "For all these steps we recommend to consult a local tax consultant. They will also help you with support payments from the Communidad Autonoma and similar issues.", 
  "faq_text16": "Don't hesitate to talk to us! We can give you a recommendation.",
  "faq_headline2": "2nd possibility - employment at a Spanish subsidiary",
  "faq_text2": "The German company already has branches in Spain. For tax reasons, the talent will therefore be employed by a Spanish subsidiary. It will work either from an existing office or remotely from home office for the tasks of the German company. Spanish labour law applies.",
  "faq_text22": "For each branch (e.g. computer science) there are separate Working statutes -Statutos de trabajadores-. The conditions in the employment contract must at least be based on the regulations contained therein.",
  "faq_headline3": "3rd possibility - employment at the German company (remote from Spain)",
  "faq_text3": "The German company registers in Spain.", 
  "faq_text31": "Step 1: First of all it needs a CIF (Spanish tax number for companies). In order to apply, all the founding and registration documents of the German company have to be translated by an official translator and provided with an apostille in Germany. These documents must then be submitted to the Spanish tax office.",
  "faq_text32": "Step 2: Afterwards the German company must apply for a social security number. Since a representative is required in Spain, we recommend that you name your employee as your representative. He also has the power of attorney for the bank account which is also required in Spain.",
  "faq_text33": "That sounds pretty complicated?",
  "faq_text34": "LevelUP offers a registration service for foreign companies. Our multilingual staff is familiar with the company documentation of international companies and thus ensures that the CIF registration process as well as the social security registration is smooth and uncomplicated.",
  "faq_text35": "The advantage of this option is that you will have a real entry into the Spanish market and you will also receive numerous advantages when trading abroad in Spain. In addition, you pave the way in the long term for hiring additional employees in Spain and setting up subsidiaries.",
  "faq_text36": "The downside is that you have to pay taxes and social security contributions of the employee resident in Spain to the Spanish tax authorities and therefore have to fill in additional forms in your annual tax return or pay a Spanish tax consultant.",
  "faq_text37": "For the rest, the employment contract is subject to German labour law.",
  "faq_text38": "As with the Spanish subsidiary, the minimum regulations from Spain must also be complied with here.",
  "faq_headline4": "4th possibility - employment at the German company (move to Germany)",
  "faq_text4": "The Spanish talent moves to Germany and works locally in the company. The company pays taxes and social security contributions for the employee as usual in Germany. The employment contract is based on German labor law.",
  "faq_text5": "Remote possibility:",
  "faq_text6": "After 183 days you can send your Spanish employee to Spain for the first time for another maximum of 183 days (A1 certificate). For tax reasons, the employee must be resident in Germany during the absence.",
  "faq_text7": "+ What advantages does remote work offer?",
  "faq_text71": "Cost-saving and environmentally friendly:",
  "faq_text72": "Good for the environment - companies whose employees work in home offices achieve cost savings on office space.",
  "faq_text73": "By working from home, commuting is completely eliminated. This also reduces fuel consumption, exhaust emissions and fine dust pollution. Especially when it comes to international cooperation, many companies invest in regular flights and personal meetings. Today's technology makes it possible to feel more and more like a virtual part of a team. Companies that already work remotely report 1-2 face-to-face meetings per year where all employees of a department carry out joint team events and have positive experiences together.",
  "faq_text74": "Biorhythm and health:",
  "faq_text75": "Traditional office hours are not the most productive periods for all employees. Flexible working allows employees to follow their own biorhythms and adapt their working hours accordingly. In addition, balancing activities such as yoga exercises, a nap or a short walk can promote well-being. Remote work leaves time to sleep longer and to cook a fresh lunch. Many studies show that remote employees are demonstrably less ill than office employees, or that they are able to do their work even when they have a cold. This is only logical because there is no danger of infection during the cold season.",
  "faq_text76": "Concentration and performance:",
  "faq_text77": "The advantage of working anywhere is that employees can choose any environment that inspires them and increases their ability to concentrate. They have the possibility to switch off sources of interference such as telephone, television and loud noises. There are no customers or colleagues to interrupt the flow of work. Fewer interruptions and noise sources in turn promote productive work. Do you often have the best ideas at home? No wonder, creativity is also demonstrably increased when the employee is in his or her own chosen environment.",
  "faq_text78": "Work Life Balance:", 
  "faq_text79": "The home office work model makes it easier to combine professional and private activities. Flexible working means that breaks or the time freed up by the absence of commuting times are available for leisure and family. During these time slots, employees can bring their child to the care centre, take the dog for a walk, go shopping at the bakery, call the parents or take care of other private matters. So you offer your employee real added value and that means -life-. Often THE decisive argument to motivate especially representatives of generation Y and Z to apply for a job at your company."
